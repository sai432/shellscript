I have just installed Java SE Development Kit 8u91 on my 64 bit Windows-10 OS. I set my path variables . I tried java --version in my command prompt it gave me an error.

c:\Users\Onlymanu>java --version
Unrecognized option: --version    
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine. 
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
But when i tried java -version it worked.
